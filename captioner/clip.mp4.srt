1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:05,154
The second value like

2
00:00:05,192 --> 00:00:08,022
that. And then the third one we need to add is a CNAME record.

3
00:00:08,096 --> 00:00:11,718
So we just need to go to C name. It needs

4
00:00:11,804 --> 00:00:16,182
a www as the host and

5
00:00:16,196 --> 00:00:19,266
we just post that in there like that. We're going to save changes.

6
00:00:19,448 --> 00:00:22,966
So currently these are the three records needed for web flow.

7
00:00:23,038 --> 00:00:26,766
Now if you have already done your Facebook prep you will also

8
00:00:26,828 --> 00:00:30,810
have a Facebook verification encode in here which will be a.

9
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:35,658
Txt record. It will look a little like that and

10
00:00:35,684 --> 00:00:38,502
then you'll have your I believe it does use an app and then you'll have

11
00:00:38,516 --> 00:00:41,970
a Facebook verification code which will be something like Facebook

12
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:48,102
verification equals and then it

13
00:00:48,116 --> 00:00:50,982
will be a string of numbers like that. You can get this from Facebook and

14
00:00:50,996 --> 00:00:54,330
I would advise if you haven't done this already, you will need to do it

15
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:57,078
because we need the Pixel code that you'd have made from that training as well.

16
00:00:57,104 --> 00:01:00,342
So I do recommend going back and doing the Facebook prep if you've got

17
00:01:00,356 --> 00:01:02,862
to this point so far, I'm just going to cancel that because I don't need

18
00:01:02,876 --> 00:01:06,102
to add that record. So once we've got these three records added now these can

19
00:01:06,116 --> 00:01:08,430
take a little bit of time to propagate.

20
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:13,014
It can take up to 72 hours to propagate but that is very

21
00:01:13,112 --> 00:01:16,758
uncommon. You will notice here I'm going to go

22
00:01:16,784 --> 00:01:20,566
back into web flow and on these two things. Now I need to check status

23
00:01:20,698 --> 00:01:23,958
and as you can see mine has already gone through. So that's the first one

24
00:01:23,984 --> 00:01:26,382
done. Then we're going to hit check status on the second one and there we

25
00:01:26,396 --> 00:01:30,282
go is done. So now this domain is completely added and

26
00:01:30,296 --> 00:01:33,846
that's what I mean is generally most domains will happen almost

27
00:01:33,908 --> 00:01:38,062
instantaneously depending on the host you're using. The reason we recommend Name Cheap

28
00:01:38,086 --> 00:01:41,902
is because it is a very good host. It is very fast, but if you're

29
00:01:41,926 --> 00:01:45,922
using something like GoDaddy or whatever it can take longer and it is recommended

30
00:01:45,946 --> 00:01:48,798
like an industry standard that it can take all the way up to 72 hours

31
00:01:48,884 --> 00:01:52,494
but it is fairly rare. So once that's done

32
00:01:52,592 --> 00:01:55,758
and we've made the www default, we're going to head over to the

33
00:01:55,784 --> 00:01:59,658
editor settings. Now inside Editor We don't really need to do

34
00:01:59,684 --> 00:02:02,898
anything. What you can do change is you can change the logo here to

35
00:02:02,924 --> 00:02:06,142
your company, but it doesn't really matter because you're not really going to be handing

36
00:02:06,166 --> 00:02:09,882
out your editor status at all anyway. Inside Billing is

37
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:12,798
where you'll see all your billing so you can keep up to date on how

38
00:02:12,824 --> 00:02:16,218
it's working and what subscriptions is where you cancel through site Plan upgrade your site

39
00:02:16,244 --> 00:02:20,130
plan it's fine. Past invoices Inside SEO

40
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:20,880
what.
